oh yo, you heard about **matSFX** yet? nah? well, let me tell you about this dope music platform I’ve been working on. its like Spotify, but no ads, open-source, and its still in alpha so things are gonna keep getting better.  

matSFX is all about getting the music you want without the distractions. simple design, easy to use, and of course, it’s free. everythings built to make sure you just hit play and chill.
